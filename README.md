# Cybersecurity Data Science
Notes and Applications from Infosec's Cybersecurity Data Science Learning Path. This repository attempts to summarize key techniques covered in the Cybersecurity Data Science Learning Path available on the InfoSec Skills platform ([link to training](https://www.infosecinstitute.com/skills/learning-paths/cybersecurity-data-science/)). For each technique, I tried to include an additional exercise and apply it on other datasets.

<i>With increased understanding around how limited the resources were from the learning path mentioned above (lack of available datasets and comprehensive guidance), I have decided to include lessons learned from other courses and learning paths related to cybersecurity data science and security analytics in general.</i> As of June 2020, this repo will also contain materials from the following learning path on Infosec Institute:
* Machine Learning for Red Team Hackers

## Techniques Covered
* Anomaly Detection using Isolation Forest (<em> Isolation_Forest.ipynb </em>)
