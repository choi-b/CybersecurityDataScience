# Cybersecurity Data Science
Notes and Applications from Infosec's Cybersecurity Data Science Learning Path. This repository attempts to summarize key techniques covered in the Cybersecurity Data Science Learning Path available on the InfoSec Skills platform ([link to training](https://www.infosecinstitute.com/skills/learning-paths/cybersecurity-data-science/)). For each technique, I tried to include an additional exercise and apply it on other datasets.

## Techniques Covered
* Anomaly Detection using Isolation Forest (<em> Isolation_Forest.ipynb </em>)
